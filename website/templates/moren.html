    <strong>importance of  potassium in plants ; </strong>                      Plants use potassium for a variety of purposes. Depending on the kind of plant and stage of growth, these roles change. 
Potassium aids in photosynthesis and can enhance root development and drought resistance. It contributes to the production of starchy, nutrient-dense grains, which is essential for grain production. 
Additionally, potassium can increase plant protein content and increase their resistance to water loss. 
Thus, having enough potassium can stop wilting. Additionally, it can help a plant become more resistant to nematodes and stop the spread of some illnesses

  <h1> Recognising Plants That Are Deficiency in Potassium</h1>
A shortage in potassium causes severely restricted plant development and leaves that are tinged yellow or purple. With browning and curling at the leaf margins and yellowing between and around the veins, older, lower leaves have a wilted appearance.
If left untreated, the symptoms will spread to the top, younger leaves, causing the older leaves to start dying off. The plant's resistance to disease and infection is compromised by deficiencies.
* Lower, older leaves frequently turn yellow.
Young leaves may wrinkle and curl; all growth will be stunted; stems may be soft or, in cases of advanced deficiency, stiff and brittle; necrosis will frequently be present at the tips of the leaves as well as patches on them.

<h1>Recognising Plants That Are Deficiency in Potassium</h1>
<p>when do plants uses The majority of potassium is absorbed by plants early in life, particularly in comparison to the two other main macronutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen. 
    In reality, during this period, a plant can meet up to 80% of its potassium requirements. This is partly due to the fact that plants need potassium in order for their stomata, which are plant components required for photosynthesis, to open and close. 
    However, potassium is not limited to that. Potassium is necessary for the phloem, the tissue that transports sugars and other metabolic products from leaves, and the xylem, the tissue that transports nutrients and water from the roots to the leaves and shoots, to grow and function as the plant ages. 
    Plants cannot transfer nutrients if they do not have enough potassium in their bodies
